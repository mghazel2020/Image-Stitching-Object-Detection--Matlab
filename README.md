# Image-Stitching-Object-Detection--Matlab


# 1. Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate two important computer vision functionalties:

* Panorama construction via image stitching and mosaicking
* Object detectuon and recognition via and template feature matching.

# 2. Experimental Setup

In order to implement the desired image stitching and object recognition algorithms, we setup the following scenarios:

* Suppose we have template images of a set of objects:
  * In our application, we have template images of 5 different books
* We shall clutter these 5 books nearby each other:
  * The books are cluttered on the floor near each other with some separation between consecutive books
  * The books are also randomly oriented when placed on the floor 
  * The 5 books are arranged almost linearly
* Using a phone camera, acquire multiple images from left to write in such a way:
  * There is at least one book in each image
  * There a relatively significant overlay between consecutive images
  * At least part of one object appears in 2 consecutive images
  * The images are ordere from left-to-right.
